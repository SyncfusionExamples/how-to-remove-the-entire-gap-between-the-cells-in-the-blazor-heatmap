# Example of removing the entire gap between the cells in the Syncfusion Blazor HeatMap component
In this Blazor project, we created a sample to demonstrate how to remove the entire gap between the cells in the Blazor HeatMap.

In this sample project, we can customize the distance of the gap between cells in the HeatMap component by using [Width](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.HeatMap.HeatMapCellBorder.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_HeatMap_HeatMapCellBorder_Width) property in the [HeatMapCellBorder](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.HeatMap.HeatMapCellBorder.html) tag. Considering the [Width](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.HeatMap.HeatMapCellBorder.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_HeatMap_HeatMapCellBorder_Width) for the border of the cell is set to zero, there remain space between the cells. However, setting the CSS style **shape-rendering** to **crispEdges** directly to the SVG element to eliminate the gap between the cells.
